-----APOSTROPHE CATASTROPHE-----
problem: for some reason, question="what isn't the worst subject" answer="not computer science" did not get added to the database
investigation:narrowed it down to apostrophe causing issues
added apostrophe manually to myswl database
noticed in the command, it prefaced any apostrophe with a backslash (screenshot)
etc
solution:had it search for apostrophe and add a backslash

----QUESTION SOMETIMES DISAPPEARS IN ANSWERING SYSTEM----
